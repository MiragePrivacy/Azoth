/// Module for computing analytical metrics to evaluate EVM bytecode obfuscation transforms.
///
/// Implements a minimal set of metrics quantified by bytecode size, control flow complexity,
/// stack usage, and dominator overlap to assess transform potency (analyst effort) and gas
/// efficiency. The module provides functions to collect metrics from a `CfgIrBundle` and
/// `CleanReport`, compare pre- and post-obfuscation states, and compute
/// dominator/post-dominator pairs for control flow analysis.
///
/// # Usage
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let (cfg_ir, _, _, _) = azoth_core::process_bytecode_to_cfg("0x600160015601", false).await.unwrap();
/// let metrics = metrics::collect_metrics(&cfg_ir, &report).unwrap();
/// println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&metrics).unwrap());
/// ```
